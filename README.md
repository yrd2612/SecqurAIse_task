# SecqurAIse_task
task for SecqurAIse internship
I have completed the task given but there are a few issues with the code  

a) I am able to successfullly track the white ball but labelling it as "white" is very difficult since it merges with the background. Also since it is a ping pong ball it has dents all over the body which creates local shadow regions making it further difficult for the program to identify its colour.  
b) Due to involvement of shadows sometimes the program looses the track of the ball colour(though it can recognise that its a ball), so it registers multiple entry exists. I have tried to rectify it to the maximum extent by adding a code to not register fake entry exists but still they are present at many instances.
